## 🌱 Our Inspiration

**ScoreSight** was born during the **FinForge Hackathon 2025**, hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG) at NTU.  
Our goal? To harness the power of **AI to revolutionize financial decision-making** for companies and institutions.

We discovered a strong correlation between corporate decisions, stock performance, and **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** indicators. Recognizing the complexity of evaluating such multidimensional metrics, we built ScoreSight — an intelligent platform that leverages **AI algorithms and data compression techniques** to simplify insights and support informed, responsible decision-making.
