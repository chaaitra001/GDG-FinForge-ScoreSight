- Returns two potential growth strategies based on your input.(x)
- Simulates and compares their ESG scores.
- Visualises individuals' decisions for profitability
- Recommends the optimal path that balances impact with financial value.
- Visualizes the investment vs. profitability relationship using dynamic graphs.
- Provides traceable sources for all output through a reference button.

## üå± Our Inspiration
ScoreSight was born during the FinForge Hackathon 2025 hosted by Google Developer Groups (GDG) at NTU. The goal? To harness AI for real-world financial decision-making.
Our team identified a strong correlation between corporate decision-making and stock price performance, which is significantly influenced by Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores. In light of this insight, we developed a project that utilizes data compression algorithms to streamline this information, thereby assisting companies in making informed decisions.
